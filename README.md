User's order is placed at 09:44:03 which was cancelled after 09:50:00 by user himself due to user's position sufferring magnificent loss in very short time, this user was forced to close this long position at much lower price around 0.55.

At meanwhile, Binance shows that the price was 0.00712 at 09:44:04, which means, user's sell order @ 0.00703 should be filled if those information is true.

And there are more similar orders actions during this period (from 09:44:00 to 09:50:00), and those fake information caused this user suffering 8000 USDT loss. However this user cannot provide those order information due to Binance delete many of user's order history afterwards. According to this user's statement that he is pretty sure that there are 'sell order @ 0.00710' and 'sell order @ 0.00716' was not traded during that time.
